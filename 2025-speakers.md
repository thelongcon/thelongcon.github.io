    <p>Our Call for Presentations for The Long Con 2025 is now open!</p>

    <p>If you're interested in being a speaker, sign up here <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyX7iradq2s9yerCgs12QKfEfaIwGai5KyYo4GgivhE32YAA/viewform">using our Google Form</a>. Feel free
    to share this link to anyone you think would do a great job! If you have
    any questions, email the organizers at <a href="mailto:organizers@thelongcon.ca">organizers@thelongcon.ca</a>.</p>

    <p>We are looking for presentations that talk about infosec tools, specific exploits,
    legal issues, privacy, defensive and offensive measures, cryptography, password cracking,
    reverse engineering, lockpicking, and software-defined radio. If your presentation doesn't fit
    into any of those categories, pitch it anyway! Topics that “aren’t infosec” are often interesting
    and appropriate for our audience. We will advise you if we think your presentation needs to be
    adjusted before we consider it, and offer recommendations. We especially encourage you to submit
    to this CFP if you’ve never presented at a conference before. You will find the audience is very supportive.</p>

    <p>The conference runs a single speaking track with presentations expected to be
    20 minutes or 50 minutes, followed by a few minutes for Q&A, but the format can be flexible if you have some ideas, contact
    <a href="mailto:organizers@thelongcon.ca">organizers@thelongcon.ca</a> if you have an idea!</p>

    <p>Please note that our Call for Presentations closes September 3rd, 2025 at 11:59pm.</p>
