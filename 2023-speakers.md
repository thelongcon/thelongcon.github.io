      <p class="abstract">As a recent founder who has spent a lot of the last year helping other founders with their security, I've come to realise that there is a lot of mystery and basic knowledge gap when it comes to keeping your product and infrastructure secure that the average technical founder or small team simply doesn't have a grasp on.

In this talk I'll dive into many of the security issues SaaS and tech enabled companies tend to encounter as well as how to prevent and detect them without spending $$$$$.

 From the OWASP top 10, SAST tooling, compliance frameworks, and even building out a VDP and shutting down "beg" bounty hunters, I'll walk through a check list of everything a company can do to increase their security posture without dramatically increasing spend.

      <p class="abstract">Is it secure? I'm asked this on a daily basis and I believe I might have a pragmatic answer. This submission introduces a refined approach to enhance security, quality, and consistency in solution delivery through Test-Driven Architecture (TDA).

The core challenge addressed is the prevalence of inconsistent and frequently overlooked security requirements, resulting in vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and business risks. Our solution centers around the systematic codification of security requirements within a publicly accessible repository, bolstered by an automated framework that seamlessly integrates with existing tools. The outcomes are clear: consistent inclusion of security requirements, proactive risk mitigation, expedited delivery, sustained visibility, and cost reduction.

The overarching vision extends beyond security alone. It envisions a world where all requirements, not just security, are captured in structured and testable formats. This framework can be universally applied, improving solutions across industries and domains. TDA, the proposed methodology, is the linchpin that defines solutions through tangible, testable requirements.

This submission delineates the essential building blocks of this transformative approach. Gherkin, a versatile language for documenting requirements, forms the foundation. Low-code tools cater to non-technical users, simplifying the process of requirement collection and management. Converters that transition Gherkin to Policy as Code (PaC) bridge the gap between requirements and implementation, while orchestration through CI/CD hooks ensures seamless integration into existing workflows.

In conclusion, TDA emerges as a potent methodology, capable of elevating solution quality, consistency, and security to unprecedented levels. I call upon the community to validate the approach. If it is sound, let us join forces in codifying security requirements and crafting the essential framework and tools. Collaboration is the key to realizing this transformative vision. Let us embark on this journey towards a secure, efficient, and harmonized future of solutions delivery.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Badgelife culture involves making custom badges for various events and conferences.  Though not always, these badges are often electronic.  Many creators may have ideas, but have never made a custom PCB or custom electronic device.  This talk is intended to take those who may have played with an Arduino and help them understand the process -- and difficulties -- in turning their idea into a functional badge, along with caveats and suggestions for their first attempt.  Even if you've never built anything electronic, it's my hope you'll understand what's involved, and maybe be inspired to go forth and build something yourself.  I'll cover refining your idea for badgelife, realistic projects for a first try, and setting up a timeline.  Then I'll discuss the steps -- schematic capture, PCB layout, PCB manufacture, PCB assembly (both paid and DIY), and firmware options.</p>

      <p class="abstract">How do Red Teams continually improve the effectiveness of Blue teams? Watch this talk to find out! This talk deep dives into how Red and Blue teams help improve each other through doing Offensive Security exercises. We cover the full life cycle from what an offensive security exercise is, how we plan, execute and measure them. This talk is targeted at giving all everyone a behind the scenes look at how incident response and offensive teams operate.

      <p class="abstract">When it comes to meaningful improvements to your security posture, there is nothing that gives you better value for your money than a comprehensive log collection and aggregation deployment. In this talk, Travis will persuade you of the value of a formal logging program, compare and contrast this to a SIEM, and talk about how you can get going with logging today.</p>

      <p class="abstract">There are two types of multitasking - I'll let you guess what they are - but when we invented those, we started down a path that inexorably led us to the worst possible outcome. And then after that, Kubernetes. This talk discusses how we got here, why we should have made a left, not a right, maybe, back at that old house with angry badgers in it, and why Kubernetes is what it is, isn't what it isn't, and where we might end up next.</p>
      <p class="bio">Bio: "Ask Mike about math, AWS, photography, science, space, or dad jokes, and you'll found someone who will to talk for a lot longer than is socially acceptable, or respectful. He's got no formal training in his day job, and pretends, at length, to be good at it. Ask him about math.... I dare you."</p>

      <p class="abstract">Pledge is a system call that empowers a program to limit itself. Originally coming out of OpenBSD, this concept is seeing increased usage and has been ported to Linux.  If a process breaks a pledge that it has made it is terminated. This allows programmers to increase security, and heavily mitigates supply chain attacks. It can also be used in a wrapper, effectively guarding against malicious actions.  This is an introductory talk and will go over basic usage.</p>
