    <p class="abstract">Every lock picker knows that the TSA approved Travel Sentry/Safe Skies locks are garbage, but if you don’t want your normal checked bags to have their locks cut off, there are only so many options. While this knowledge is common to lock sport folks, the average traveler is mostly unaware of it. This talk will cover the 7 master keys used by the TSA, non-destructive attack methods to open the locks, efforts to reproduce the master keys by reverse engineering the locks, and what TSA approved locks are the best of a bad situation.</p>

  </div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">We are all familiar with DOS and DDOS attacks, but what is a TDOS attack? TDOS attacks are on the rise world-wide, and there is little that can be done about it today. With the cost of VoIP services dropping, and the rise of black hat VoIP services in countries that ignore law enforcement requests, we are experiencing a rise in Telephony spam, much like email did in the late 90's. This talk will go over the architecture of an attack, and explain in detail how it works, along with a live demo where Cian attacks a volunteer audience member's cell phone. What is to be done about this threat? Do we give up on the PSTN and admit defeat, or do we learn from the tactics of the past where we learned how to mitigate the mass volumes of spam world wide? This talk will conclude by outlining a high level plan for Canada to combat this threat.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) has become a staple in the cyber-attack measurement and reporting diet. Be it sensationalist and hyperbole-filled language, or the lack of any meaningful and consistent measurement methodology, the end result is the same: zero clarity concerning an already complex subject matter which serves to continue rather than counter the cyber-crime threat. The public discussion (via media reports) and business insight (through myriad methodologies of mis-measurement) need to be better framed if we as an industry are to truly confront the growing and increasingly expensive problem of cyber-crime. Who the criminals were is of less import than how they got in; compromise indicators are more valuable to other businesses than the financial cost to that particular victim. The measurement metric dial has moved too far towards attribution and needs to be reset to prevention and a business-based analysis of risk once more.</p>

    <h5 class="speaker">Mark Jenkins</h5>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">If you want to authenticate that a PC's firmware and boot loader are unaltered, hardware based solutions such as trusted platform module (TPM), Intel boot guard, Intel Platform Trust Technology (PTT) and AMD equivalents probably come to mind. Such contemporary hardware features may not be affordable, available, or trusted. An approach that works on older computers acts as a hedge, available if hardware makers become malicious and as additional competitive discouragement for them to do so and undermine general-purpose computing as we know it. We assess the feasibility for the following soft approach: 1) A special boot verifier is loaded from secondary storage by firmware 2) Over a local connection, a trusted second computer sends random parameters for a difficult hashing problem to the boot verifier, this problem requires the contents of firmware and boot relevant parts of secondary storage as inputs and demands the entirety of RAM be utilized 3) Solutions at particular checkpoints to the hashing problem are transmitted to the second trusted computer 4) The secondary computer verifies not just the correctness of all solutions, but their timing of transmission against an established benchmark for the machine tested. For older x86 hardware without virtualization extensions (where hardware access for transmission can introduce a significant performance penalty), the idea is that any attempts at virtualization or hiding a malicious payload with the help of paging will show a detectable performance hit on timing. The threat model is an attacker who can only alter the firmware, boot loader, and boot verifier code loaded from secondary storage. The attacker is assumed to not be able to make hardware modifications undetectable to inspection, including overclocking and installation of transmitters to offload the hashing problem. This is for local (non-remote) attestation only. We have written a prototype for a non-SMP x86 computer and tested problem parameters that produce timing detectable results under a hypervisor/virtualizer and assess if these parameters are feasible for practical use.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Big data is the fuel of modern economy. It allows us to do better urban planning, combat new diseases, ensure national security, and has become the driving force behind innovation, productivity, and growth. All these new possibilities are enabled by new technologies that are capable of storing, integrating, and analyzing all sorts of digital breadcrumbs that we leave behind in this information age. On one hand, the collected data offers tremendous opportunities for mining useful information. On the other hand, the mining process poses a threat to individual privacy since the collected data often contains sensitive information. The current practice in data sharing relies primarily on policies and guidelines on the types of data that can be shared and agreements on the use of shared data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection. This talk will present the recent research results that try to find a right balance between the privacy protection and big data rewards. In particular, this talk will explain different definitions of privacy model, show their limitations, describe some algorithms to enforce them, and discuss open problems for future research.</p>

    <p class="abstract">The design and implementation of network and system segmentation in medium to large environments can be challenging as there appears to be no common approach for implementation and communication of segmentation to technical and business units. This talk will describe the challenges of such implementation and summarize the potential solutions for physical and logical alignment, and its socialization. The material presented will be based on recent and ongoing experience with designing, implementing, and communicating network and system segmentation via numerous hands-on table top exercises, and analysis of numerous literature sources.</p>

    <p class="abstract">The state of TLS/SSL is changing at a rapid pace over the last year and its use and implementation is being dragged around by the ear by the browser vendors. What are the consequences of implementing modern TLS in complicated and regulated environments? How has TLS been used in these environments to date? How do we design services which implement all of the benefits of TLS but also limit their impact to infrastructure and regulatory costs? Are TLS and PKI strategies identical and aligned across application stacks and portfolios? This talk will give examples of the ways TLS has been used in Enterprise infrastructure over the years and will discuss possible solutions and strategies to meld the seemingly incompatible requirements of regulatory compliance and end-to-end security.</p>
