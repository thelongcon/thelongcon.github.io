      <p class="abstract">Is your software secure? Every single day companies ship new code, features, and products that people entrust their data with. Yet so many of those applications remain live for years without ever being professionally tested by penetration testers.

As hackers, it's our job to uncover these flaws. Learn about some of the real-world (anonymized) vulnerabilities we've seen, how we exploited them, and the impact they would have had if malicious hackers had found them first.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene, LLMs and generative AI have been all anyone can talk about. Today, more companies are putting generative AI into their products, regardless of whether or not it makes sense to do so. After which, your poor cybersecurity teams are left with the responsibility of both testing and defending this new technology without the training or experience in how to do such a task. In this talk, we'll provide a detailed look at the new threat landscape of generative AI applications and how to defend them. We'll review bug bounty submissions and cutting-edge techniques used against real companies over the past year. From there, we'll talk about how to mitigate these vulnerabilities to prevent them from slipping into your organization. By the end of the talk, you will walk away with a better understanding of generative AI security and what to look out for moving forward.</p>

      <p class="abstract">In an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, proactive threat hunting has emerged as a critical strategy for organizations seeking to stay ahead of adversaries. Let's explore some of the methodologies and practices essential for effective cyber threat hunting and identifying and mitigating potential threats before they can cause harm.

The session will emphasize the importance of telemetry in the threat hunting process, detailing the various types of data—such as logs, network traffic, and endpoint activity—that are crucial for uncovering hidden threats.  Practical examples and case studies will illustrate how telemetry can be leveraged to track adversaries' movements, behaviors, and tactics.  The goal being how to integrate effective threat hunting methodologies with comprehensive telemetry to enhance their organization's security posture and resilience against cyber threats.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Zeroconf is a set of protocols and standards meant to create a sort of "plug n play" experience for networked devices and network services. This can be achieved through a combination of many different protocols, though primarily three. Namely, mDNS (RFC6762), DNS-SD (RFC6763), and Link-Local Addressing (RFC3927) make up the bulk of Zeroconf implementations.

In this talk, we'll have fun together imagining some potential abuses of these protocols, look at some proofs of concept, and notice some interesting things about specific implementations along the way. Expect no zero-days -- In fact, I expect all of these have been thought of before -- but instead a casual meandering through some obvious abuses, complete with screenshots you'll have to squint to read.</p>

      <p class="abstract">An exploration of techniques, tactics and psychological models used in the infiltration of emerging threat actor groups. Our personas are fabrications and constructions of our inner self that we project outwards. We do this through various means and influences such as race, gender, sex, ability, age, culture, religion, norms, class, and status. For the “real world” aka “irl” we do all this by expression in our clothing, makeup, hairstyling, our hobbies, our network of friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. We leverage all of these facets and we create masks, personas, that we think will best interact with the world around us. The same concepts apply when creating personas for infiltrating online communities.

What makes a good persona and what makes a bad persona? Persona’s can vary wildly in quality, many factors contribute to the quality of a persona, for example how tailor is it to the mission, how good is the operational security of the account, how good are you at managing it and leveraging it to establish yourself in a community. Understanding what you can construct and where limitations lie. If you know nothing about the community you are trying to infiltrate you will have a hard time establishing a foothold even more so any significant persistence in the community. We will also look at the concept of Timeshifting persona’s so they appear online. What is your Mission? Know your target: Identify, Probing, Gathering, Verifying, Analyzing, and Distribution of Intelligence obtained by your personas. Executing your Mission Real Example of Infiltration of a RaaS operation. Exfiltration / Means of Exiting</p>

      <p class="abstract">It doesn’t matter how advanced your shellcode loader is, if you don’t protect your shellcode from prying AV & EDR sensors, you’re going to have a bad time. From simple encryption schemes like the Caesar cipher to more complex schemes like AES, reversing arrays, steganography, encoding shellcode as other data types, and other techniques, this talk will cover a variety of ways to hide shellcode in your loader. I’ll demonstrate how these techniques score against many engines using VirusTotal. In some cases, AV engines will detect the decoding routine. I’ll also discuss techniques you can use to break this detection. I will also be sharing a repository demonstrating the different evasion techniques discussed in this talk. Note – this talk will not cover behavioral evasion techniques like unhooking, direct and indirect syscalls, or other evasion techniques. Whether you’re new to obfuscating shellcode or an experienced pro, there’s something in this talk for you!</p>

      <p class="abstract">Today’s workplace presents a very demanding environment, in which we are routinely asked to do more with less. This often means more hours worked, more stress, less time for relaxation and unfortunately that is a recipe for burnout.

Believe it or not, this pattern can be avoided! By leaning into our natural strengths, we can be more efficient and resilient. So let’s talk about what burnout is, how to spot it and how to prevent it. After all, it truly IS possible to achieve more by doing less!</p>
      <p class="bio">Bio: "Matias Wengiel currently works as a Full Stack Web Developer at Neo Financial. Before that, he was a post-secondary instructor in the Health Sciences. Before that he was a physician. He also went on fossil digs and found fossils! That’s not really relevant to our con, just wanted to share.

He likes to combine all three of his careers into an instructional discussion about how to avoid burnout (which is not great for your health) with a focus on the tech sector. Maybe it’s because he keeps choosing high-burnout careers and wants to help others in his same situation. Or maybe it’s because he’s trying to find a way to balance work with his endless list of hobbies and interests such as tabletop gaming, gardening, camping, cooking anything over (and sometimes under) charcoal and more!"</p>

      <p class="abstract">The number of cool devices with Bluetooth in them is insane: usb current meters, batteries, charge controllers, LED lights, sous vide devices, and other things. But they all need the weirdest apps that you download from MediaFire, are never in your own language, require every permission under the sun to run, require an account to use for some reason, and drain your battery because they're probably mining Bitcoin in the background.

This talk is a brief dig into how you would rebuild a client app for one of these devices on a more open platform, like a Bluetooth enabled microcontroller. We'll talk through how you would snoop Bluetooth traffic from an Android device, pull apart protocols, and start building your own client.</p>
