      <p class="abstract">Back in the day, stealing a car meant hotwiring it (at least in the movies I've seen). That was until some kids changed the game with some USB cables and viral TikTok's. The “Kia Boys” made headlines, but they also opened a conversation about how modern cars are basically computers on wheels… and not always secure ones.

In this talk, we’ll take a joyride through the wild world of automotive cybersecurity. From keyless entry hacks and CAN bus chaos to infotainment systems that do way more than play music, you’ll learn how today’s vehicles are vulnerable in ways most drivers never imagine. We’ll also peek under the hood of how automakers try to defend against these threats (spoiler: it’s complicated), and why standards like ISO/SAE 21434 are the new seatbelts for your car’s software.

And if there's time we’ll look ahead to the future of connected and autonomous vehicles, where the risks will grow to even higher stakes. Whether you’re a hacker, a car enthusiast, or just someone who wants to know if their ride is secretly plotting against them, this talk is your pit stop for all things vehicular and vulnerable.</p>

Not so! I talked last year about mDNS, which uses multicast to resolve names link-locally. This is LLMNR, which uses multicast to resolve names link-locally. Completely different.

This year we'll get less theoretical and more practical, and examine two common (and commonly-paired) techniques in a red-teamers toolkit: LLMNR Poisoning and NTLM Relaying. We'll poison LLMNR (inter alia) to masquerade as everybody, wait for one of those lines to hook a fish, and then relay their authentication to our targets. Very technologically advanced fish, these. 

After going through those technical details and showing a demo or two, we'll also get to my customer's favourite question, which is "How do we stop you from doing this to our network again?", and I'll discuss common mitigation techniques. </p>

      <p class="abstract">When we talk about AI workflows, most people focus on the exciting parts; models, prompts, and results. But in this talk, we will discuss MCP servers. The middleman that connects AI to the tools and data it needs to get work done. These servers bootstrap workflows, orchestrate tools, and quietly act as the gatekeepers of your AI stack. And as with any gatekeeper, a lack of understanding leaves you unaware of who else may be passing through.

In this session we will create an MCP server and integrate it with a real-world tool like Jira to show how easy it is to configure custom AI workflows into existing systems. Along the way, we’ll highlight some security concerns that turn “Making Compromise Possible” from a joke into a real risk. You’ll leave with a clearer understanding of MCP servers, their role in AI pipelines, the security implications they introduce, and practical steps you can take to keep your workflows secure.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Syndicate: Inside the Life of a RaaS Affiliate is not your usual threat actor retrospective; it’s a psychological profile in three acts. We begin with the life of a skid (script kiddie): the copy-paster, the stealer-log dopamine chaser, the clout addict living in Telegram chats and cracked panels. Their world is a blur of fake flexes and small wins; high on illusion, tethered to someone else’s payload.

Then we move to the mid-tier: ransomware operators negotiating ransoms between bites of cold noodles, barely holding their teams together, clashing over OPSEC and loyalty, and falling prey to the same scams they run. They operate in constant motion; spinning up infra, recycling brands, running Telegram polls to pick the next target. There’s no hierarchy, just reputation, vibes, and whoever controls the wallet.

Finally, we look at the syndicate tier: Conti, LockBit, BlackBasta. Where KPIs matter more than skill. Where HR processes are more dangerous than intrusion vectors. Where recruitment, churn, and burnout mirror SaaS startups; except the product is extortion, and trust is everything.

This talk draws from leaked playbooks, chat logs, and recruitment docs to unpack how affiliates function not just tactically, but structurally and socially. Attendees will leave with a renewed lens on how ransomware-as-a-service scales, and the human cost that powers it; not just threat actors, but labor inside an economy of deception.</p>

Tammy shares her research through Flare briefings, webinars, podcasts, and threat intel blogs.

Outside of work, she’s into ambient techno, matcha, street and nature photography, hiking, and amateur astronomy with a soft spot for weird particles and black hole physics. She plays tennis and badminton to stay grounded."</p>

      <p class="abstract">AV/EDR evasion is a complex and ever evolving game. While operational evasion - getting your payload executed and staying running - is complex and seemingly always getting harder, there are some surprisingly low-tech approaches to getting your payload on disk and at least executing. You have to stay hidden along the entire operation, but these simple techniques can help you get your foot in the door. We'll discuss techniques that cause some EDR to ignore your payload all together, as well as techniques that can help deter detections when you're running, including dealing with malware analysis sandboxes.</p>

      <p class="abstract">In large organizations with complex identity structures, it can be easy to lose track of who is authorized to access a service. In a University environment, for example, a person may be a student, a staff member, and a faculty member at the same time. If such a person is dismissed from employment, they remain in the system as a student, which can cause security issues if access to employee-related systems, processes, and data is retained. This talk discusses why and how we achieved automated Google and Entra ID group membership management using the open-source software system Grouper.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-7">
      <p class="abstract">This talk delves into the subtle and dark art of deanonymizing usernames. Whether you are tracking threat actors, CSAM distributors, or a broad range of criminal groups, attendees will learn about the tools of the OSINT trade that can reveal connections between seemingly disparate digital personas, often exposing the true identity behind accounts. The session will highlight the unique risks of username reuse, explore practical workflows for profiling targets across places and platforms, and introduce automated tools that streamline and visualize the complex process of mapping out digital footprints.

What sets this session apart are the dark, strange, fun, and weird real-world stories and case studies that are interwoven throughout, showcasing how these methods have been used to trace criminals, disrupt illicit online networks, and aid in digital investigations.

Through demonstrations and narratives, the audience will discover powerful new tools for their investigative arsenal but also experience some “digital detective work” in action.
