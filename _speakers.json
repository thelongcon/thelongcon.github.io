After which, your poor cybersecurity teams are left with the responsibility of both testing and defending this new technology without the training or experience in how to do such a task. In this talk, we'll provide a detailed look at the new threat landscape of generative AI applications and how to defend them. We'll review bug bounty submissions and cutting-edge techniques used against real companies over the past year. From there, we'll talk about how to mitigate these vulnerabilities to prevent them from slipping into your organization. By the end of the talk, you will walk away with a better understanding of generative AI security and what to look out for moving forward.",

        "abstract": "An exploration of techniques, tactics and psychological models used in the infiltration of emerging threat actor groups. Our personas are fabrications and constructions of our inner self that we project outwards. We do this through various means and influences such as race, gender, sex, ability, age, culture, religion, norms, class, and status. For the “real world” aka “irl” we do all this by expression in our clothing, makeup, hairstyling, our hobbies, our network of friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. We leverage all of these facets and we create masks, personas, that we think will best interact with the world around us. The same concepts apply when creating personas for infiltrating online communities.\n\nWhat makes a good persona and what makes a bad persona? Persona’s can vary wildly in quality, many factors contribute to the quality of a persona, for example how tailor is it to the mission, how good is the operational security of the account, how good are you at managing it and leveraging it to establish yourself in a community. Understanding what you can construct and where limitations lie. If you know nothing about the community you are trying to infiltrate you will have a hard time establishing a foothold even more so any significant persistence in the community. We will also look at the concept of Timeshifting persona’s so they appear online. What is your Mission? Know your target: Identify, Probing, Gathering, Verifying, Analyzing, and Distribution of Intelligence obtained by your personas.
