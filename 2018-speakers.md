      <p class="abstract">Modern GPUs have made it possible to quickly recover random, factory set passwords on embedded devices. This talk will specifically dive into attacking the default, WPA Pre-Shared key (PSK) formats for several popular mobile WiFi hotspots. It will also cover ways to improve attack methodology and present several ways for manufactures, administrators and users to reduce the risk of compromise from a weak default WPA PSK. Attendees will learn how WPA deauthentication attacks are performed and the significance of modern GPUs in recovering Pre-Shared Keys.</p>

Whether it be mergers and acquisitions, spun up cloud environments, or any other assets forgotten/not properly decommissioned over the years, it can be a challenge to put together a comprehensive and accurate inventory. This talk will go over a number of publicly available datasets that one can use to view what everyone else on the internet can find out about your digital footprint and passively monitor for changes.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a complex and highly versatile service that makes it useful for a wide variety of applications, from static website serving to backup and storage. These properties also make it notorious for being frequently misconfigured and poorly understood.

      <p class="abstract">Getting started with web apps can be a daunting task. "Ooh, shiny!" rabbit holes are just around the corner with every click. Without a good plan and a road map, it can be very easy to get lost in these holes and run out of time before reaching your goal. This talk covers how to identify the goal and set up a plan that will help you avoid the rabbit holes, identify the points you should focus on, and ultimately help you become an effective application tester.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Security Testing, when performed, is usually done at the end of the application development cycle, increasing the risk of delays and cost increase in the project if problems or errors are found. It is possible to overcome, or at least minimize, this problem by using the “Shift Security Left” (SSL) approach, by introducing security checks and validations in the software development lifecycle and performing automated security testing within the project pipeline. This talk aims to demonstrate some ways on how to implement the SSL approach in your development lifecycle and what tools can be used to automate security testing and vulnerability management by performing multiple checks and validations throughout the application development process.</p>

      <p class="abstract">When people think “abuse”, most people are still thinking about throwing punches and name-calling. However, as the reliance on technology grows, so does the ability to use it to exert power over others. Technological abuse can be harder to identify because we're not as familiar with it. This talk explores the different ways technological abuse may manifest itself and how we can empower people to leave a relationship, avoid future abusive relationships and help others to do the same.</p>

She presented topics of personal interest at Prairie Dev Con Deliver and BSidesWinnipeg in 2017. She will be graduating from Red River College's Business Information Technology program in June 2019 and wants to secure a role as an analyst.

Recognized as one of the great legends in machine learning, several of Brandon's machines have learned so much that philosophers argue turning them off would be murder.
