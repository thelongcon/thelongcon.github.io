      <p class="abstract">There is never enough budget or time to solve every security problem an organization faces. However, there are a lot of free or inexpensive tactics and techniques that every organization can leverage to make it harder for attackers to enter your environment. This presentation is a collection of basic tips and tricks learned from security professionals around the world These are tactics that either stop attackers in their tracks, or make it more difficult for them to succeed. You’ll walk away with actionable tips to fill your security gaps and help reduce your attack surface.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-7">
      <p class="abstract">The current model for penetration testing is broken. The typical scan and exploit model doesn’t reflect how real attackers operate after establishing a foothold. At the same time, most organizations aren’t mature enough to need a proper red team assessment.  It’s time to start adopting the assumed breach model. In this talk, I’ll discuss techniques for assumed breach assessments that provide a better model for emulating the techniques attackers use once they’re they’ve established a foothold inside a typical network.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Burp Suite is one of the most well known and well used set of tools for AppSec testing. This talk aims to demonstrate how it can be possible to easily start testing web applications and look for common vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, LFI, IDOR, CSRF, and many others. In addition to demonstrate how to use Burp, we'll talk about the basic knowledge involved with AppSec testing that is usually more important than knowing how to use the tool itself. Some of the things we will cover are: HTTP, Requests, Responses, Web Proxy, Burp Suite and Burp tools and features like Target, Proxy, Spider, Intruder and Repeater. If you are either a Pentester, AppSec professional or Bounty Hunter and would like to know about how Burp works and start testing web applications and exploiting them for vulnerabilities this talk is for you. All features will be demonstrated using the Burp Community edition.</p>

      <p class="abstract">For the past year, Praetorian and Priceline have been working together to conduct a series of Purple Team exercises to improve Priceline’s Detection and Response. These exercises utilized tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to baseline Priceline’s telemetry and analysis capabilities. Praetorian leveraged their recently released Metasploit Framework fork to rapidly automate basic TTPs before working cooperatively with Priceline for more advanced tests. Priceline then did the heavy lift of ingesting that data, prioritizing shortcomings, and making strategic and tactical decisions to improve their security program. Through the use of ATT&CK, they were able to trace specific lines of effort back to various TTPs. This traceability helped provide support for various decisions as well as facilitated with prioritization. ATT&CK also provided a common taxonomy when working with vendors when gaps in detection were identified. Finally, ATT&CK helped Priceline track improvements through later rounds of testing to help measure the effectiveness of various improvements.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-7">
      <p class="abstract">Home automation systems are split primarily into the two camps of open (and open-source), and proprietary. Proprietary systems have an advantage in that they are typically managed by a third party (for a fee, often paired with an alarm system) and they come with a preselected collection of devices the managing party guarantees work nicely together. This talk will explore how to reverse engineer these systems, and regain the granularity and robustness of control that open systems provide, while retaining the managed nature of the system.</p>

Today, vehicles are more complex and as much computer as they are machine. You've likely heard the horror stories of self driving cars getting hacked. Maybe that's made you fearful. But what about cars you have to drive yourself? With today's Bluetooh-equipped, dashcam-set-up, Internet connected vehicles, how much do we need to worry about security updates?

      <p class="abstract">GraphQL is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. It provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc web service architectures. It is a fairly new language, but it is already being used on a lot of companies all over the world. As with every new language it brings pros and cons. The goal of this presentation is to present this language from a security perspective. We will understand how it differs from the current REST architecture and how attackers can exploit it with a few abuse case scenarios. We'll provide real-world examples of how to exploit GraphQL web applications using only free tools at your disposal. If you are a developer, pentester or bounty hunter and would like to know more about the benefits and the risks of using GraphQL on your application, this talk is for you!</p>
