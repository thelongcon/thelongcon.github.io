    <p class="abstract">Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard that blockchains are the solution.  Have a problem (ANY problem) in need of a solution?  Blockchain it!  Of course, the hype doesn't match reality.  This talk will cover basic blockchain algorithm concepts, explain what sort of problems are particularly well suited to blockchains, and talk a bit about why infosec doesn't have those problems.</p>
    <p class="bio">Like all great cyber security thought leaders, Brandon Enright is a self-aggrandizing Twitter *****.  When he isn't leading cyber infosec thoughts, he's leading cyber dreams.  Brandon can factor large primes with nothing more than pencil and paper and even recite the digits of Pi in random order in arbitrary bases.  Recognized as one of the great legends in machine learning, several of Brandon's machines have learned so much that philosophers argue turning them off would be murder. Rumor has it that shortly after Elon Musk met Brandon, Elon bought a small island in the south pacific for shelter and revised his estimate of the coming singularity up a decade.  Brandon is why Bruce Schneier has trouble sleeping at night.</p>

    <p class="abstract">Security Testing, when performed, is usually done at the end of the application development cycle, increasing the risk of delays and cost increase in the project if problems or errors are found. It is possible to overcome, or at least minimize, this problem by using the “Shift Security Left” (SSL) approach, by introducing security checks and validations in the software development lifecycle and performing automated security testing within the project pipeline. This talk aims to demonstrate some ways on how to implement the SSL approach in your development lifecycle and what tools can be used to automate security testing and vulnerability management by performing multiple checks and validations throughout the application development process.</p>

    <p class="abstract">Regular, enforced password rotation has been a part of the generally accepted best security practices for decades. However, password rotation not only provides no benefit to security, it can actually make an organization less secure. In this talk, I am going to explain why mandatory password rotation should join other, backward practices like bloodletting and asbestos insulation on the trash heap of history.</p>
    <p class="bio">Travis misspent 10 years studying computers and network security at the University of Manitoba before being unleashed on an unsuspecting world. After spending some time writing autopilot software for UAVs, he settled into a career in InfoSec, working in the education sector and founding Flying Fortress IT, a firm which specializes in providing small and medum businesses with security and cloud infrastructure expertise.</p>
