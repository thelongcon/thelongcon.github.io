    <h5 class="speaker">Brandon Enright</h5>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">The latest marketing fad and hype in our industry is the pushing of machine learning as a magic panacea for all cyber ills. We're told that by utilizing artistically crafted pixie dust and rainbow unicorn algorithms all your cyber woes can cured. Unfortunately, otherwise rational people in our industry seem to give a lot of weight to these marketing claims because 1) machine learning is complicated and 2) we've seen machine learning do some really incredible things like drive cars, beat the best Go players, "dream" crazy images, etc. This talk will illustrate some of the hype we're being bombarded with, pull back the covers on what machine learning is and how it works, present some basic statistics (Bayesian) and show why security is a much harder problem for machine learning than we realize. </p>

    <p class="bio">Like all great cyber security thought leaders, Brandon Enright is a self-aggrandizing media <span style="background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: white">REDACTED</span>. When he isn't leading cyber infosec thoughts, he's leading cyber dreams. Brandon can factor large primes with nothing more than pencil and paper and even recite the digits of Pi in random order in arbitrary bases. Recognized as one of the great legends in machine learning, several of Brandon's machines have learned so much Harvard is working on granting them PhDs. Rumor has it that shortly after Elon Musk met Brandon, Elon bought a small island in the south pacific for shelter and revised his estimate of the coming singularity up a decade. Brandon is why Bruce Schneier has trouble sleeping at night.</p>

  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">This talk will discuss some of the core design objectives Fastly had regarding their WAF implementation. Christian will discuss the design of Fastly's custom Modsecurity toolchain, and the need to thoroughly test both their code and WAF rule sets using the FTW WAF testing framework. He will discuss how continuous testing of their rules and toolchain helps identify WAF evasion and technical issues which are used to improve their technology. Finally Christian will discuss some findings and insights that we have shared with the OWASP and security communities.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Commercial radio communications have evolved from islands of single-media, low-datarate "dumb" analog repeaters to interconnections of multiplexed, high-speed, self-optimizing multimedia networks. Due to budgetary and legacy reasons, many amateur radio systems have not changed notably in the last decades. Unwilling to let this great hobby (and emergency resource) atrophy, the dedicated VA4WAN group is installing a High-Speed MultiMedia "HAMWAN" around and beyond Winnipeg, repurposing donated 2.4/5.8ghz outdoor Wi-Fi gear into the 2.3/5.9Ghz amateur radio frequency bands. This presentation introduces the amateur radio hobby, the VA4WAN project's goals, methods, current status and future plans.</p>

    <p class="abstract">Scraping data from the Internet is an old practice, but one that is more and more popular these days. Pricerazzi scrapes pricing and product data from retailers to facilitate price matching. Unsurprisingly, retailers have a wide range of quality in their sites, apps, and systems; they have seen many questionable things ranging from simple poor practice to severe security issues. This will be a discussion on the state of retail websites in 2017.</p>

    <p class="abstract">With public cloud adoption accelerating by all measures, the task of understanding how to deploy secure applications and architectures using the tools available in these environments is increasingly complex. This talk will cover the important aspects of public cloud security including products and tools available, compliance management, application and architecture design, identity and access management, and general best-practice.</p>

    <p class="abstract">When Mike started learning buffer overflows, he thought it was something everybody else already knew. But the reality is, there are lots of us, just like hi,, who want to know more but are either overwhelmed by the idea that buffer overflows are beyond their capabilities or just don’t know where to get started. This is a 101-level talk; it’ll talk about how a buffer overflow works, how to fuzz an app to identify an overflow opportunity, and how to create a simple overflow that will result in a compromise of a target system. If you can already smash the stack, spray the heap, and write ROP chains in your sleep, this isn’t the talk for you. If you want to learn more about how simple buffer overflows work and how to write them, this talk is for you. When you leave, you will have the information necessary to help you write your first overflow when you walk out the door. </p>

    <p class="bio">Mike's love of IT started in the third grade when he discovered he could view the code of BASIC programs on an Apple ][e. Mike now performs penetration testing and vulnerability assessments for a multinational agribusiness corporation. He has held many information technology and IT security positions, including developer, network administrator, system administrator, security architect and security incident handler. Mike holds the OSCP, ISC2 CISSP, and GIAC GPEN, GWAPT, GMOB, and GCIH certifications. When he is not at work, he is an avid kayak fisherman and member of a local horn rock band.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Do As I Say, Not As I Do: Why Our Security Advice Sucks and How We Can Change That</h4>
    <h5 class="speaker">Sarah LaCroix</h5>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Let's talk about risk assessment and personal security! As technically inclined people, we are at an advantage when it comes to our privacy and security. We are more aware of the risks and consequences associated with our use of technology than the average person. For them, standard security advice is overwhelming, unrealistic and failure to comply comes with intangible consequences. Sensationalist media coverage of obscure DDoS attacks from China combined with the reality that people tend to suck at assessing risk means that the average person is more worried about the Russian government reading their email than they are of giving their own password away. On the other side of things, as professionals who have some idea of what actually can go wrong, our trouble with assessing risk tends to take us in the opposite direction. We lock everything down to the point of missing out on some of the cool things that our tech can offer us. This talk looks at how we can help ourselves and the people around us better assess their risk so we can start giving more realistic advice.</p>

    <p class="bio">Sarah started her education in technology by hanging out with IT professionals and hobbyists who were passionate about their projects. She grew that interest by volunteering at conferences and asking lots of questions. When she finally had more questions than her friends could answer, she decided it was time for a more formal education. She started with Applied Computer Science and Business Administration at University of Winnipeg, then studied Digital Forensics, Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking at Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland before transferring into the Business Information Technology program at Red River College. She is currently on the board of technology student group, Bits and Bytes Association. Never quite satisfied with her current level of knowledge, Sarah is always working to strengthen her skills and build her expertise by taking on side projects and talking to people more experienced than herself. Upon graduation (expected: June, 2019), she wants to work as a security analyst. She enjoys hipster coffee, going to the gym, and Instagramming her food. You can find her on the Internet as @punkrockgoth.</p>

    <p class="abstract">Border Gateway Protocol or BGP for short, is the standardized, open protocol that allows ISPs of all sizes to form routing relationships with other ISPs, carriers, and Internet Exchanges.

This includes useful tools Tim has found, custom scripts, and writing basic Metasploit Aux modules to get things done fast.</p>

    <p class="abstract">If we did a typical IT Risk assessment of the Titanic before its maiden voyage, would it have sailed? Would the risk of loss of life come in as "Medium-Low" with a Low likelihood? Would the risk practitioners have focused on an incremental approach of adding another 4 lifeboats, and putting in an initiative in the next fiscal year to fund four more? A tongue in cheek look at the typical problems with risk assessments in IT Security.</p>
